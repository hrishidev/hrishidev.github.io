<p>How is it going at your end?  I thought of sharing a few updates from my end as little joy and experiences get lost while looking at a larger picture of our life. I intend to write at a regular interval and call it weekly, biweekly or monthly updates. Given my bad track record of maintaining good habits, I am keeping a realistic target for writing every month and increasing frequency if required.

<h2><p style="color:#334CFF";>Learning</p></h2>
<p>To keep me distracted from the stress of the Corona pandemic,  I took up the long-pending goal of making podcasts. It took me more than two months to complete my first episode. My mentor, Sanjay Khandelwal, broaden my perspective about learning new things. Instead of handholding, he would guide me if I am stuck at something for a long time. This method of learning by making mistakes has a profound effect on the way I am picking up new skills now.  I realized my strong and weak areas and look for specific solutions myself instead of spoon-feeding.

<h2><p style="color:#334CFF";>Writing the First episode</p></h2>
<p>After so many writer’s blocks and days without motivation, distractions, and busy days at work, I have completed ✅ writing ✍️ my first episode. I took nearly two months to complete it. I promised and missed many deadlines. I thought of giving up many times, stared blankly at the laptop screen. Long way to go, There are many tasks still in the to-do list, but I am happy that I did not give up. Developing the workflow for writing a well-researched article was my biggest takeaway from that exercise.

<h2><p style="color:#334CFF";>Newsletters</p></h2>
<p>I subscribed to many newsletters but was not making most out of them.  If I keep them unread, I used to lose track of new unread emails and emails I want to revisit. There will arrive in my mailbox as per their schedule.  If I read as they come, they would disturb my planned tasks. If I mark them as read means "Out of sight, out of mind" Last month, I fixed this problem. I created a separate email ID exclusively for reading newsletters. I unsubscribed the ones which are not in sync with my current goals and subscribed to the rest of the newsletters from my newly created email ID. Now, I read them over the weekend and don't mind if I have a few unread emails in that mailbox.

Bonus Tips:-  My new email ID is a random string avoiding any reference to my identity.

<h2><p style="color:#334CFF";>Tasks Debt & Learning Debt</p></h2> 
<p> By prolonging EMI's, we end up paying more interest. Similarly, tasks debts or procrastinating and Learning Debt -not upgrading our skills, are dragging us down.
I am getting rid of these debts along with my home loan debt to make most out of 24 hours we got. With this, last month I spent more time organizing my data, my cupboards, and less on searching for a specific item as the relevant hour.

<p>Please be safe.

<p>I know there are interesting updates in your life as well. Please share them. I would like to know them.  And I would like to read your take about my updates as well.

<p>Thanks for reading.
